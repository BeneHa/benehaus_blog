I moved to Belgrade a few weeks ago and one of the things that interested me was what it is like to bike here in Serbia. So I did a couple of day tours and one 4-day tour to get a first impression.

## In Belgrade

In Belgrad, the quality of biking infrastructure depends on the part of the city you are in. New Belgrade mostly has biking paths next to the streets that are all right. The old town often does not have any biking paths and you need to be careful as you might end up on very busy and tight roads. So depending on where you go it might be fine to bike, or you might be better of using public transport. Transport is free here, and there are many bus lines driving you anywhere every few minutes, so you never need to wait long for the next bus.

## Eurovelo paths

Across the country there are some Eurovelo biking paths that you can follow all across the country and into the neighboring countries, like the well-known Danube biking path (Eurovelo 6). I tried that one between Belgrad and Bela Crkva. It is mostly a dedicated biking path, but on some parts (especially in Belgrade itself) it can also just be the main road. After you leave Belgrade, it becomes a nice scenic bike path along the Danube river. It is, however, not an easy path, especially if there was rainfall in one of the previous days.

The path consists of rough dirt and is sometimes completely overgrown with grass. In my opinion it is worth it as the scenery is beautiful but plan enough time for these parts as you might need a while.

Other bike paths across Serbia (e.g. the Eurovelo 13) give the same impression: they can be good paths, separate from the main road, or they can be just the main road with trucks going past you regularily (e.g. the Eurovelo 11 from Zrenjanin to Belgrade).

## Overall

It is too early for me to draw any final conclusions but so far I think that biking in Serbia is absolutey fine, if you put some more work into preparing your route. There are decent bike paths in most places, sometimes you might need to go a bit more offroad than you are used to, but the scenery makes it worth it. Always be prepared to turn around and drive back a bit if a path turns out to be on a road that is too big, and make sure that your bike is ready for some rough gravel and dirt roads, and you will be fine biking here!

Still, it would be nice if more bike paths were being built, especially across the capital city, so more people have a valid alternative to driving a car. And across the country, better bike paths would surely help to attract more tourists, and also provide an alternative for the locals to get from one village to the next.
