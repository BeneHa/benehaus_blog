Almost exactly three years ago, the first covid infections happend in a chinese city most people in the western world had never heard of. The world has changed a lot based on these events, and at the same time, it sometimes feels like covid did not change the world as much as we thought after all. The topic has been on my mind lately as here in Bavaria some of the last covid restrictions (e.g. mask mandate on public transport) have been lifted and so I want to write down how I currently view the topic.

In the beginning of covid, when most countries worldwide implemented some sort of lockdown, the changes to all our lives were most obvious. One common thought at the time was that these changes were some kind of equalizer across the traditional divides within societies, for example because everybody was stuck at home for holidays, whereas before the holiday destinations differed vastly mainly depending on a family's net income.
We soon realized that this was mostly wishful thinking as now the differences in income showed in other ways: Some families were able to provide all children all necessary learning equipment like laptops, a quiet place to do homeschooling and technical support by the parents in case something went wrong. These were, of course, those families that were better off financially. Disadvantaged families were as always hit harder as they could not spontaneously afford several computers for children, they had a higher risk of infection as they usually did not have jobs where remote working was possible, and in cases where both parents have to work, nobody was there to monitor children during school time.
At the same time, office workers (me included) gained some new privileges by working from home and getting even more flexible working hours - why not go for a run during the day and add one working hour in the evening? Also, these kinds ob jobs were affected by shop and restaurant closures to a smaller degree so job security was significantly higher for those jobs that paid better anyway.
These examples of the early covid times came to my mind when I thought about what had changed because of covid - there were some hopes for changes to the better but in the end it turned out that not much of these hopes remained.

Looking at what changed over a longer period, two things come to mind: masks and vaccinations. While vaccinations are commonly known, masks were previously known mostly to healthcare workers or from asian tourists. Both measures proved to be very effective, both based on anecdotal evidence and on a multitude of scientific studies that were released ever since. Both measures were also affected by economic factors, but to a lesser degree. Masks need to be bought and vaccination appointments need to be booked and might not be easy to schedule if you have one or more jobs with long or unusual working hours. But over time everyone got the possibility to use both of those measures and it was also obvious that they work fine with negligible risk and impact: wearing a mask is a minor impediment that does not hinder anyone (and there were always exceptions for people with e.g. breathing issues), and the vaccines turned out to be the most well tested medical devices in human history with an extremely small risk of side issues (yes, they happend, and yes, a few people died as a result, but looking at the numbers, it is nowhere near the same magnitude as the covid deaths).

So we have the necessary measures. There are some potential issues:
- People do not believe that the measures are working
- People believe the measures are working but do not want to use them for some other reason
- People do not see the issue is big enough that the measures are necessary

The first issue is due to misinformation, Fake News, conspiracy theories, you name it. We have seen all variants of that in the last years. Many of us were surprised to see friends and family suddenly following strange ideas they read somewhere or heard from someone. That topic is way too complex for me to discuss here and honestly, I do not really have any idea what can be done about it.

The second issue 

Factor 3:
So what happened? I guess it can be best described by some psychological phenomenons including:

the prevention paradoxon. 

post hoc fallacy

hindsight bias
